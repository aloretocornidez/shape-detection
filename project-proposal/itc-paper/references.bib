% Just because a reference is listed in this file, does not mean that it will
% appear in the PDF version of the paper.  BibTeX will only grab the references
% you use with a \cite{} command in the .tex file.
%
% You have to run the BibTeX command separately from the LaTeX command.  The
% references will not be automatically generated, you have to run BibTeX.
%
% If you want anything to appear capitalized in the title, you have to wrap it
% with {curly braces}.  For example, "IRIG" will end up looking like "irig"
% in the PDF file, unless you use "{IRIG}."
%
% The `` characters give you an "open quotation" mark, the '' characters, or
% the " character give you a "close quotation" mark.
%
% Notice that we use "and" to separate the individual author's names from
% each other.  LaTeX will automatically insert commas in the right places
% in the PDF file.
